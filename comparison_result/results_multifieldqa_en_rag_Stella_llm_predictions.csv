How does the transition probability of the environment affect the learning rate in the static agent?,"['Same as for the static agent, the learning rate increases with the distance d e (Fig. ). Then, we examine the effect of the environmental transition probability p tr on the evolved learning rate η p . In order for an agent to get sufficient exposure to each environment, we scale down the probability p tr from the equivalent experiment for the static agents.\nWe find that as the probability of transition increases, the evolved learning rate η p decreases (Fig. ). This fits with the larger trend for the static agent, although there is a clear difference when it comes to the increase for very small transition probabil-ities that were clearly identifiable in the static but not the moving agents.', 'This could be due to much sparser data and possibly the insufficiently long lifetime of the moving agent (the necessity of scaling makes direct comparisons difficult). Nevertheless, overall we see that the associations observed in the static agents between environmental distance d e and transition probability p tr and the evolved learning rate η p are largely maintained in the moving agents.', 'This means that when environmental transition is very rare, agents opt for a very low learning rate, allowing a slow and stable convergence to an environment-appropriate weight vector that leads to very low losses while the agent remains in that environment. As the rate of environmental transition increases, faster learning is required to speed up convergence in order to exploit the (comparatively shorter) stays in each environment.', ""A final factor that affects the learning rate the EA will converge to is the frequency of environmental change during an agent's lifetime. Since the environmental change is modeled as a simple, two-state Markov process (Fig. ), the control parameter is the transition probability p tr . When keeping everything else the same, the learning rate rapidly rises as we increase the transition probability from 0, and after reaching a peak, it begins to decline slowly, eventually reaching zero (Fig. )."", 'Finally, as the environmental transition becomes too fast, the agents opt for slower or even no learning, which keeps them ) and the decision (b.) tasks, for a variety of parameters (p tr = 0.01, d e ∈ 0, 0.1, . . . , 1, and σ ∈ 0, 0.1, . . . , 1 in all 100 combinations).

What is the problem encountered when building the fuselage sides?,"['While building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying ""banana"" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder\'s fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of', ""Initially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home), the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical"", 'First understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the ""projected"" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are ""foreshortened"" and don\'t give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron.

What are the three phases of the author's preaching process?,"['This has really driven most of my sermons to-date, especially because I usually have only a few weeks’ notice. I preached on Ahab because I had just read about him in my devotions. I preached on the tree and its fruits because I had just studied the passage in the context of LGBT acceptance. Most recently, I preached on 1 Corinthians because that’s what we’ve been studying in Sunday School. The more I know something ahead of time, the better chance I have of knowing what to look for and how to communicate it.\nOnce I have my topic, I start running the passage through a system in the three phases we used in seminary: exegetical, theological, and homiletical.\nPhase 1: Exegetical', 'I’m not a preacher; I’m a theologian. But now that I’ve graduated seminary I sometimes have the honor of preaching. And as someone who just barely passed the two required preaching courses while he was focused on other things, I’ve had to go back and really develop a theology and strategy of preaching. It should go without saying that it’s a work in progress, but I’m at a place now where I’m comfortable with my system—which means the next step is to share it. Maybe someone out there can benefit from what I’ve learned, but either way there’s always room for improvement and maybe you can help me see where.\nTopic/Text Selection', 'The exegetical phase is just getting into the passage itself. First, I want to know the immediate context for the passage. Why is this here? What ideas are continuing, and which are new? How the author frames the passage is probably the most important factor in choosing how I will introduce it in the sermon. If it’s an epistle, I will also play with a structural outline to try and identify rhetorical choices.', 'In short, the question raising and answering process is really the beginning of the theological phase for me. I’m looking for key ideas and trying to identify the timeless truths they communicate. Now there’s a danger here: you can use a passage to communicate all kinds of good theology. I think it’s much better when you can identify the theology the author was trying to communicate.', 'Third—and frankly this is the step I’m most likely to skip—I try to choreograph my movements. I believe good preaching is theater, but not in the sense that you’re dramatizing the text. Your whole body is communicating whether you want it to or not, so your gestures should be purposeful. Use the space to organize thoughts, repeat certain motions when you repeat the same thought, make sure you’re not sending mixed signals.

How does the infall rate and gas density in the magnetized model compare to non-magnetized accretion?,"['Compared to non-magnetized accretion, infall rate is 2-5 times\nsmaller depending on outer magnetization.

So, either gas\ndensity $n$ or electron temperature $T_e$ or magnetic field $B$\nare small in the inner flow or combination of factors works. Thus\nlow gas density in magnetized model is in qualitative agreement\nwith the results of modelling the spectrum.', 'Magnetic field inhibits accretion \\citep{schwa}. None of many\ntheories has reasonably calculated the magnetic field evolution\nand how it influences dynamics. These theories have some common\npitfalls.

In third, dynamical effect of\nmagnetic field is calculated with conventional magnetic energy and\npressure.

Issues within archaeobotany may include the conflict between having to publish results within excavation monographs, which may take some time to be published, and have limited visibility due to high purchase costs and no', 'Given that there are numerous examples of meta-analysis which do take place in archaeobotany, it seems likely that the prevalent form of data sharing is through informal data sharing between individual specialists. However, this does not improve access to data in the long term, and is inefficient and time consuming, with large potential for data errors (Kansa & Kansa 2013), and relies on personal networks, which are likely to exclude some researchers.

Therefore, the following discussion of symptoms applies primarily to affected individuals in the past and unfortunately in some underdeveloped countries now. If untreated, beta thalassemia major can lead to severe lethargy, paleness, and delays in growth and development.

How are smartphones and tablets different from a technical perspective?,"[""While phones and tablets are mobile devices that often share a great deal of software, it's becoming increasingly clear the two are very different products. These two markets have started to diverge and will continue doing so over time."", 'In contrast, tablets are far more akin to the PC both technically and economically. The power budget for tablet SoCs is much greater, up to 4W for a passively cooled device and as high as 7-8W for systems with fans. This alone means there is a much wider range of tablet designs than smartphones. Moreover, the default connectivity for tablets is Wi-Fi rather than a cellular modem. The vast majority of tablets do not have cellular modems, and even fewer customers actually purchase a wireless data plan. As a result, cellular modems are almost always optional discrete components of the platform. The software ecosystem is relatively similar, with Microsoft, Apple, and Google OSes available.', 'Looking forward, these distinctions will likely become more pronounced. Many tablets today use high-end smartphone SoCs, but the difference in power targets and expected performance is quite large. As the markets grow in volume, SoCs will inevitably bifurcate to focus on one market or the other. Even today, Apple is doing so, with the A6 for phones and the larger A6X for tablets. Other vendors may need to wait a few years to have the requisite volume, but eventually the two markets will be clearly separate.\nHorizontal business model evolution', 'From a technical perspective, smartphones are far more compact and power constrained. Smartphone SoCs are limited to around 1W, both by batteries and by thermal dissipation. The raison d’etre of a smartphone is connectivity, so a cellular modem is an absolute necessity. For the cost sensitive-models that make up the vast majority of the market, the modem is integrated into the SoC itself. High-end designs favor discrete modems with a greater power budget instead. The main smartphone OSes today are iOS and Android, though Windows is beginning to make an appearance (perhaps with Linux or BlackBerry on the horizon). Just as importantly, phone vendors like HTC must pass government certification', ""I'm not so sure about several things:1- Moore's law's relevance. Moore's Law is about ICs. ICs are not as big a part of mobile computers as they are of desktops, even of laptops: screens, batteries, radios are a huge part of tablets' and phones' costs, as opposed to the bare SoC + RAM.2- The tablet vs phone dichotomy. For some reason (probably price insensitivity due to subsidies), Phones have a tendency to be more powerful than Tablets, ie phone SoCs are more than good enough for tablets.

What is the advantage of decorrelating the data before running the PLS algorithm?,"['Singer et al. ( ) studied the convergence rates of the PLS algorithm for dependent observations and showed that decorrelating the data before running the PLS algorithm improves its performance. Since Y is a linear combination of columns of X, it can be assumed that Y and all columns of X have the same correlation structure.\nHence, it is sufficient to estimate Σ = cov(Y ) to decorrelate the data for the PLS algorithm, i.e., Σ −1/2 Y = Σ −1/2 Xβ + Σ −1/2 results in a standard linear regression with independent errors. Our goal now is to estimate Σ and compare the performance of the PLS algorithm on original and decorrelated data.', 'Therefore, we set q = 1 for the VST-DCT estimator to match the low smoothness of the corresponding spectral density. Moreover, the smoothing parameter is selected with the restricted maximum likelihood method and T = 550 bins are used. Obviously, the performance of the PLS algorithm on the decorrelated data is significantly better for the small number of components.', 'black line in the left plot) confirms that the covariance matrix estimated with our VST-DCT method almost completely decorrelates the channel diameter Y on the training data set.Next, we estimated the regression coefficients β with the usual PLS algorithm, ignoring the dependence in the data.Finally, we estimated β with PLS that takes into account dependence using our covariance estimator Σ.Based on these regression coefficient estimators, the prediction on the test set was calculated.The plot on the right side of Figure 2 shows the Pearson correlation between the true channel diameter on the test set and the prediction on the same test set based on raw (grey) and decorrelated data (black).', 'Figure 3: On the left, the auto-correlation function of Y (grey) and of Σ−1/2 Y (black), where Σ is estimated with the VST-DCT method; On the right, correlation between the true values on the test data set and prediction based on partial least squares (in grey) and corrected partial least squares (black).', 'In particular, with just one PLS component, the correlation between the true opening diameter on the test set and its prediction that takes into account the dependence in the data is already 0.54, while it is close to zero for PLS that ignores the dependence in the data. showed that the estimator of β based on one PLS component is exactly the ensemble-weighted maximally correlated mode (ewMCM), which is defined as the collective mode of atoms that has the highest probability to achieve a specific alteration of the response Y .']",['Decorrelating the data before running the PLS algorithm improves the performance of the algorithm.'],8232,multifieldqa_en,en,,425c85c840db6f65192aa477d41c9c18a60a4ccaf0e1e6df,The performance of the PLS algorithm is significantly better for a small number of components.,0.3636363636363636,0.5

What are some potential applications of ferromagnetic semiconductors?,"['In the past few years, the synthesis of ferromagnetic semiconductors has become a major challenge for spintronics. Actually, growing a magnetic and semiconducting material could lead to promising advances like spin injection into non magnetic semiconductors, or electrical manipulation of carrier induced magnetism in magnetic semiconductors \\cite{ohno00,Bouk02}. Up to now, major efforts have focused on diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) in which the host semiconducting matrix is randomly substituted by transition metal (TM) ions such as Mn, Cr, Ni, Fe or Co \\cite{Diet02}. However Curie temperatures ($T_{C}$) in DMS remain rather low and TM concentrations must be drastically raised in', 'raised in order to increase $T_{C}$ up to room temperature. That usually leads to phase separation and the formation of secondary phases. It was recently shown that phase separation induced by spinodal decomposition could lead to a significant increase of $T_{C}$ \\cite{Diet06,Fuku06}. For semiconductors showing $T_{C}$ higher than room temperature one can foresee the fabrication of nanodevices such as memory nanodots, or nanochannels for spin injection. Therefore, the precise control of inhomogeneities appears as a new challenge which may open a way to industrial applications of ferromagnetism in semiconductors.', 'The increasing interest in group-IV magnetic semiconductors can also be explained by their potential compatibility with the existing silicon technology. In 2002, carrier mediated ferromagnetism was reported in  MBE grown Ge$_{0.94}$Mn$_{0.06}$ films by Park \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Park02}. The maximum critical temperature was 116 K. Recently many publications indicate a significant increase of $T_{C}$ in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ material depending on growth conditions \\cite{Pint05,Li05,tsui03}.

How does the specific-heat ratio affect the average motion of the bubble?,"['However, when the shock wave passes through the bubble (t > 0.03), a larger specific-heat ratio speeds up the average motion of the bubbles. The reason is that the bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio need more energy to compress their size, so their translational energy is smaller.', 'Therefore, the characteristic scales of bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratio tend to be compressed smaller. It can also be seen that the case with the largest specific-heat ratio reaches the minimum characteristic scales firstly. The reason is that the shock wave propagates faster in case with larger specific-heat ratio.\nThrough the method of tracer, information on the average motion of the bubble is easy to obtain. Shown in Fig. are the average position and average velocity of the bubble, with different specific-heat ratios. It is found that, in the shock compression stage (t < 0.03), the effect of specific-heat ratio contributes little to the average motion.', 'Effects of specific-heat ratio on vortex motion', 'For the bubble, the smaller the specific-heat ratio, the slower average motion. In the shock compression stage, the specific-heat ratio contributes little effects to the vortex motion. Differently, after the shock passes through the bubble, it significantly influences the vorticity around the interface and the corresponding amplitude of circulation due to the development of KHI.\nThe larger the difference in specific-heat ratio between the bubble and ambient gas, the higher the degree of material mixing.

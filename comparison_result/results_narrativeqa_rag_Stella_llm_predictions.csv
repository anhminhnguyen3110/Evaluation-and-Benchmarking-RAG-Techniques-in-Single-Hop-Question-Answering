In short I think we were all happier as well as poorer\nbefore; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths of his brother\nand his nephew has lately become Lord Maddock.

Why does Ann not return Mary's feelings of affection?,"['Ann did not take notice of either his or Mary\'s behaviour, nor did she\nsuspect that he was a favourite, on any other account than his\nappearing neither well nor happy. She had often seen that when a person\nwas unfortunate, Mary\'s pity might easily be mistaken for love, and,\nindeed, it was a temporary sensation of that kind. Such it was--why it\nwas so, let others define, I cannot argue against instincts. As reason\nis cultivated in man, they are supposed to grow weaker, and this may\nhave given rise to the assertion, ""That as judgment improves, genius\nevaporates.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAP.

When her friend was all the world to her, she\nfound she was not as necessary to her happiness; and her delicate mind\ncould not bear to obtrude her affection, or receive love as an alms, the\noffspring of pity. Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility."", 'Mary did not choose to explain herself; had Ann lived, it is probable\nshe would never have loved Henry so fondly; but if she had, she could\nnot have talked of her passion to any human creature. She deliberated,\nand at last informed the family, that she had a reason for not living\nwith her husband, which must some time remain a secret--they stared--Not\nlive with him! how will you live then? This was a question she could not\nanswer; she had only about eighty pounds remaining, of the money she\ntook with her to Lisbon; when it was exhausted where could she get more?\nI will work, she cried, do any thing rather than be a slave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.', ""Could the contemplation of such a people gratify Mary's heart? No: she\nturned disgusted from the prospects--turned to a man of refinement.\nHenry had been some time ill and low-spirited; Mary would have been\nattentive to any one in that situation; but to him she was particularly\nso; she thought herself bound in gratitude, on account of his constant\nendeavours to amuse Ann, and prevent her dwelling on the dreary prospect\nbefore her, which sometimes she could not help anticipating with a kind\nof quiet despair."", 'I mentioned before, that Mary had never had any particular attachment,\nto give rise to the disgust that daily gained ground. Her friendship for\nAnn occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed,\nseveral transient likings; but they did not amount to love. The society\nof men of genius delighted her, and improved her faculties. With beings\nof this class she did not often meet; it is a rare genus; her first\nfavourites were men past the meridian of life, and of a philosophic\nturn.']",['Because she is in unrequited love with someone else'],23316,narrativeqa,en,,26c6325283dece0b557e34cde9a5c57999ec5c68782e8194,unanswerable,0.0,0.0

Why does Socrates ultimately decide it is unjust to escape?,"[""SOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do"", ""Whether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no"", ""Socrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death"", 'before his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.', 'CRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.']",['Because it violates his belief in the  laws of society.'],6595,narrativeqa,en,,585ce1f974c0a35526da31a0cdc1541728ffc2df6a73b4f3,unanswerable,0.0,0.0

To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.', 'CRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.', ""'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.

Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.

The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.

What is Saltram's living situation?,"['ordinary person, as Saltram himself would have been if he hadn’t been a\nprodigy.

Why does Ann not return Mary's feelings of affection?,"[""Mary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these\nconsequences produced.

Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility."", 'Ann did not take notice of either his or Mary\'s behaviour, nor did she\nsuspect that he was a favourite, on any other account than his\nappearing neither well nor happy. She had often seen that when a person\nwas unfortunate, Mary\'s pity might easily be mistaken for love, and,\nindeed, it was a temporary sensation of that kind. Such it was--why it\nwas so, let others define, I cannot argue against instincts. As reason\nis cultivated in man, they are supposed to grow weaker, and this may\nhave given rise to the assertion, ""That as judgment improves, genius\nevaporates.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAP.

""I cannot see him; he is not the man formed for me\nto love!"" Her delicacy did not restrain her, for her dislike to her\nhusband had taken root in her mind long before she knew Henry. Did she\nnot fix on Lisbon rather than France on purpose to avoid him? and if Ann\nhad been in tolerable health she would have flown with her to some\nremote corner to have escaped from him.', 'Mary did not choose to explain herself; had Ann lived, it is probable\nshe would never have loved Henry so fondly; but if she had, she could\nnot have talked of her passion to any human creature. She deliberated,\nand at last informed the family, that she had a reason for not living\nwith her husband, which must some time remain a secret--they stared--Not\nlive with him! how will you live then? This was a question she could not\nanswer; she had only about eighty pounds remaining, of the money she\ntook with her to Lisbon; when it was exhausted where could she get more?\nI will work, she cried, do any thing rather than be a slave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.', 'I mentioned before, that Mary had never had any particular attachment,\nto give rise to the disgust that daily gained ground.

Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.

To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.', ""SOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.

What are some important themes mentioned in this story?,"['This tale that I am about to tell is of a little boy who lived and\nsuffered in those dark middle ages; of how he saw both the good and the\nbad of men, and of how, by gentleness and love and not by strife and\nhatred, he came at last to stand above other men and to be looked up to\nby all. And should you follow the story to the end, I hope you may find\nit a pleasure, as I have done, to ramble through those dark ancient\ncastles, to lie with little Otto and Brother John in the high\nbelfry-tower, or to sit with them in the peaceful quiet of the sunny\nold monastery garden, for, of all the story, I love best those early\npeaceful years that little Otto spent in the dear old White Cross on the\nHill.', '""Tis strange,"" said the old woman, ""that no one should have told thee\nin all this time."" And then, in her own fashion she related to him the\nstory of how his father had set forth upon that expedition in spite of\nall that Otto\'s mother had said, beseeching him to abide at home; how he\nhad been foully wounded, and how the poor lady had died from her fright\nand grief.', 'The nobles who stood near smiled at the boy\'s speech. As for the\nEmperor, he laughed outright. ""I give thee thanks, my Lord Baron,"" said\nhe; ""there is no one in all my court who has paid me greater courtesy\nthan that.""\n\nSo comes the end of our tale.\n\nBut perhaps you may like to know what happened afterward, for no one\ncares to leave the thread of a story without tying a knot in it.\n\nEight years had passed, and Otto grew up to manhood in the Emperor\'s\ncourt, and was with him through war and peace.', ""Sitting upon the edge of his bed and gazing into his face with wide open\neyes, she would listen to him by the hour, as he told her of his life in\nthat far away monastery home; of poor, simple brother John's wonderful\nvisions, of the good Abbot's books with their beautiful pictures, and of\nall the monkish tales and stories of knights and dragons and heroes and\nemperors of ancient Rome, which brother Emmanuel had taught him to read\nin the crabbed monkish Latin in which they were written."", ""This was only the first visit of many from the little maid, for after\nthat she often came to Otto's prison, who began to look for her coming\nfrom day to day as the one bright spot in the darkness and the gloom.""]","['Be responsible,keep your word and be wise and peaceful.']",27741,narrativeqa,en,,787d7fce3ea3a5afc996204942227e91ad057b882c3d3633,"Gentleness, love, suffering, growth.",0.0,0.0

Once or twice in\nthe afternoon it had for an instant occurred to me that perhaps his\njourney was not to be fruitless, that perhaps we had all been wrong in\nour estimate of the works of Enoch Soames.  That we had been horribly\nright was horribly clear from the look of him.  But, ""Don\'t be\ndiscouraged,"" I falteringly said.  ""Perhaps it\'s only that you--didn\'t\nleave enough time.  Two, three centuries hence, perhaps--""', '""A hundred years hence, as now,"" he smiled, ""no smoking allowed in the\nreading-room.

She was educated with the expectation of a\nlarge fortune, of course became a mere machine: the homage of her\nattendants made a great part of her puerile amusements, and she never\nimagined there were any relative duties for her to fulfil: notions of\nher own consequence, by these means, were interwoven in her mind, and', 'A little girl who attended in the nursery fell sick.

He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one\nwhich had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of\nthe tragedy.  This he filled with the same oil as that used at the', 'It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes\nbroke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat coiled in his\narmchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue\nswirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead\ncontracted, his eyes vacant and far away.  Finally he laid down his\npipe and sprang to his feet.', ""One realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes's phlegmatic\nexterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the\nmoment that he entered the fatal apartment.  In an instant he was tense\nand alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with\neager activity.  He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round\nthe room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing\nfoxhound drawing a cover.  In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around\nand ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some\nfresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud\nejaculations of interest and delight.  Then he rushed down the stair,"", '""Why a fire?"" he asked once.  ""Had they always a fire in this small\nroom on a spring evening?""\n\nMortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that\nreason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  ""What are you going to do\nnow, Mr. Holmes?"" he asked.', 'I glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes\ntook his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound\nwho hears the view-halloa.  He waved his hand to the sofa, and our\npalpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon\nit.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman,\nbut the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes\nshowed that they shared a common emotion.\n\n""Shall I speak or you?"" he asked of the vicar.\n\n""Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and\nthe vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the\nspeaking,"" said Holmes.']",['The remains of afire in the fireplace.'],10013,narrativeqa,en,,c22368c99a8cf7d7a3a2bc96d1faeffd21403576f605519b,unanswerable,0.0,0.0
What kind of business was Anthony Rogers working for in 1927?,"['I should state therefore, that I, Anthony Rogers, am, so far as I know,\nthe only man alive whose normal span of eighty-one years of life has\nbeen spread over a period of 573 years. To be precise, I lived the first\ntwenty-nine years of my life between 1898 and 1927; the other fifty-two\nsince 2419. The gap between these two, a period of nearly five hundred\nyears, I spent in a state of suspended animation, free from the ravages\nof katabolic processes, and without any apparent effect on my physical\nor mental faculties.', 'It all resulted from my interest in radioactive gases. During the latter\npart of 1927 my company, the American Radioactive Gas Corporation, had\nbeen keeping me busy investigating reports of unusual phenomena observed\nin certain abandoned coal mines near the Wyoming Valley, in\nPennsylvania.', '""This looks like business,"" Wilma remarked to me with sparkling eyes.\n(And I might mention a curious thing here. The word ""business"" had\nsurvived from the 20th Century American vocabulary, but not with any\nmeaning of ""industry"" or ""trade,"" for such things being purely community\nactivities were spoken of as ""work"" and ""clearing."" Business simply\nmeant fighting, and that was all.)\n\n""Did you bring all this equipment from the valley?"" I asked the Gear\nBoss.', ""The Boss' set was triple powered, so that his orders would cut in on any\nlocal conversations, which were indulged in, however, with great\nrestraint, and only for the purpose of maintaining contacts."", '""We\'ll risk it,"" said Wilma and I together.\n\n""Good for you,"" replied the Boss. ""Take command then, Rogers, for the\npresent. Do you all know his voice, boys?""\n\nA chorus of assent rang in our ears, and I began to do some fast\nthinking as the girl and I ducked into the twisted mass of metal.\n\n""Wilma, hunt for that record,"" I said, knowing that by the simple\nprocess of talking I could keep the entire command continuously informed\nas to the situation. ""On the hillsides, keep your guns trained on the\ncircles and stand by. On the hilltops, how many of you are there?

What embedding techniques are explored in the paper?,"['Recently, word embeddings BIBREF9 have become a popular method for measuring semantic relatedness in the biomedical domain. This is a neural network based approach that learns a representation of a word by word co–occurrence matrix. The basic idea is that the neural network learns a series of weights (the hidden layer within the neural network) that either maximizes the probability of a word given its context, referred to as the continuous bag of words (CBOW) approach, or that maximizes the probability of the context given a word, referred to as the Skip–gram approach. These approaches have been used in numerous recent papers.', 'There is a long history in using distributional methods to discover semantic similarity and relatedness (e.g., BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 ). These methods are all based on the distributional hypothesis, which holds that two terms that are distributionally similar (i.e., used in the same context) will also be semantically similar BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 . Recently word embedding techniques such as word2vec BIBREF9 have become very popular. Despite the prominent role that neural networks play in many of these approaches, at their core they remain distributional techniques that typically start with a word by word co–occurrence matrix, much like many of the more traditional approaches.', 'Finally, we compared our proposed method to other distributional approaches, focusing on those that used word embeddings. Our results showed that integrating semantic similarity measures into second–order co–occurrence vectors obtains the same or higher correlation with human judgments as do various different word embedding approaches. However, a direct comparison was not possible due to variations in the subsets of the UMNSRS evaluation dataset used. In the future, we would not only like to conduct a direct comparison but also explore integrating semantic similarity into various kinds of word embeddings by training on pair–wise values of semantic similarity as well as co–occurrence', 'and dictionary entries BIBREF24 . Such embeddings could be integrated into a second–order vector or be used on their own.', 'In addition, a previous work very closely related to ours is a retrofitting vector method proposed by YuCBJW16 that incorporates ontological information into a vector representation by including semantically related words. In their measure, they first map a biomedical term to MeSH terms, and second build a word vector based on the documents assigned to the respective MeSH term. They then retrofit the vector by including semantically related words found in the Unified Medical Language System. They evaluate their method on the MiniMayoSRS dataset.']","['Skip–gram, CBOW', 'integrated vector-res, vector-faith, Skip–gram, CBOW']",4259,qasper,en,,710f7452388fe5d22e2329697dbc4fa17d2c9a53daedafa6,word2vec

What can word subspace represent?,"['subspace representation.', 'To tackle this problem, we introduce the novel concept of word subspace. It is mathematically defined as a low dimensional linear subspace in a word vector space with high dimensionality. Given that words from texts of the same class belong to the same context, it is possible to model word vectors of each class as word subspaces and efficiently compare them in terms of similarity by using canonical angles between the word subspaces. Through this representation, most of the variability of the class is retained. Consequently, a word subspace can effectively and compactly represent the context of the corresponding text. We achieve this framework through the mutual subspace method (MSM) BIBREF9', 'The word subspace formulation presented in Section ""Word subspace"" is a practical and compact way to represent sets of word vectors, retaining most of the variability of features. However, as seen in the BOW features, the frequency of words is relevant information that can improve the characterization of a text.

How do they define robustness of a model?,"['Conclusion and Discussions\nThis paper investigates into the problem of how to leverage prior knowledge robustly in learning models. We propose three regularization terms on top of generalized expectation criteria. As demonstrated by the experimental results, the performance can be considerably improved when taking into account these factors. Comparative results show that our proposed methods is more effective and works more robustly against baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the robustness problem of leveraging knowledge, and may inspire other research.', ""However, a crucial problem, which has rarely been addressed, is the bias in the prior knowledge that we supply to the learning model. Would the model be robust or sensitive to the prior knowledge? Or, which kind of knowledge is appropriate for the task? Let's see an example: we may be a baseball fan but unfamiliar with hockey so that we can provide a few number of feature words of baseball, but much less of hockey for a baseball-hockey classification task. Such prior knowledge may mislead the model with heavy bias to baseball. If the model cannot handle this situation appropriately, the performance may be undesirable."", 'In this paper, we investigate into the problem in the framework of Generalized Expectation Criteria BIBREF7 . The study aims to reveal the factors of reducing the sensibility of the prior knowledge and therefore to make the model more robust and practical. To this end, we introduce auxiliary regularization terms in which our prior knowledge is formalized as distribution over output variables. Recall the example just mentioned, though we do not have enough knowledge to provide features for class hockey, it is easy for us to provide some neutral words, namely words that are not strong indicators of any class, like player here.

What is te core component for KBQA?,"['Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) systems answer questions by obtaining information from KB tuples BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 . For an input question, these systems typically generate a KB query, which can be executed to retrieve the answers from a KB. Figure 1 illustrates the process used to parse two sample questions in a KBQA system: (a) a single-relation question, which can be answered with a single $<$ head-entity, relation, tail-entity $>$ KB tuple BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF2 ; and (b) a more complex case, where some constraints need to be handled for multiple entities in the question. The KBQA system in the figure performs two key tasks: (1)', 'Compared to previous approaches, the main difference is that we have an additional entity re-ranking step after the initial entity linking. We have this step because we have observed that entity linking sometimes becomes a bottleneck in KBQA systems. For example, on SimpleQuestions the best reported linker could only get 72.7% top-1 accuracy on identifying topic entities. This is usually due to the ambiguities of entity names, e.g. in Fig 1 (a), there are TV writer and baseball player “Mike Kelley”, which is impossible to distinguish with only entity name matching.', 'The third block of the table details two ablation tests for the proposed components in our KBQA systems: (1) Removing the entity re-ranking step significantly decreases the scores. Since the re-ranking step relies on the relation detection models, this shows that our HR-BiLSTM model contributes to the good performance in multiple ways. Appendix C gives the detailed performance of the re-ranking step. (2) In contrast to the conclusion in BIBREF4 , constraint detection is crucial for our system. This is probably because our joint performance on topic entity and core-chain detection is more accurate (77.5% top-1 accuracy), leaving a huge potential (77.5% vs. 58.0%) for the constraint detection', 'In order to assess how the proposed improved relation detection could benefit the KBQA end task, we also propose a simple KBQA implementation composed of two-step relation detection. Given an input question and a set of candidate entities retrieved by an entity linker based on the question, our proposed relation detection model plays a key role in the KBQA process: (1) Re-ranking the entity candidates according to whether they connect to high confident relations detected from the raw question text by the relation detection model. This step is important to deal with the ambiguities normally present in entity linking results. (2) Finding the core relation (chains) for each topic entity', 'The main focus of this work is to improve the relation detection subtask and further explore how it can contribute to the KBQA system. Although general relation detection methods are well studied in the NLP community, such studies usually do not take the end task of KBQA into consideration. As a result, there is a significant gap between general relation detection studies and KB-specific relation detection. First, in most general relation detection tasks, the number of target relations is limited, normally smaller than 100. In contrast, in KBQA even a small KB, like Freebase2M BIBREF2 , contains more than 6,000 relation types.

Why masking words in the decoder is helpful?,"[""From the view of BERT or other contextualized embeddings, the refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes. Intuitively, this process works as follows: first the draft decoder writes a summary draft based on a document, and then the refine decoder edits the draft. It concentrates on one word at a time, based on the source document as well as other words.\nWe design the word-level refine decoder because this process is similar to the cloze task in BERT's pre-train process, therefore by using the ability of the contextual language model the decoder can generate more fluent and natural sequences."", ""As Eq. () shows, the decoder's learning objective is to minimize negative likelihood of conditional probability, in which $y_i^*$ is the i-th ground truth word of summary.\nHowever a decoder with this structure is not sufficient enough: if we use the BERT network in this decoder, then during training and inference, in-complete context(part of sentence) is fed into the BERT module, and although we can fine-tune BERT's parameters, the input distribution is quite different from the pre-train process, and thus harms the quality of generated context representations."", ""If we just use the embedding matrix here, it will be more difficult for the decoder with fresh parameters to learn to model representations as well as vocabulary probabilities, from a relative small corpus compared to BERT's huge pre-training corpus. In a word, the decoder cannot utilize BERT's ability to generate high quality context vectors, which will also harm performance.\nThis issue exists when using any other contextualized word representations, so we design a refine process to mitigate it in our approach which will be described in the next sub-section."", 'Although our experiments are conducted on summarization task, our model can be used in most natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, question generation and paraphrasing.

We demonstrated for the first time an effective MNER system, where visual information is combined with textual information to outperform traditional text-based NER baselines. Our work can be applied to myriads of social media posts or other articles across multiple platforms which often include both text and accompanying images. In addition, we proposed the modality attention module, a new neural mechanism which learns optimal integration of different modes of correlated information. In essence, the modality attention learns to attenuate irrelevant or uninformative modal information while amplifying the', 'Our contributions are three-fold: we propose (1) an LSTM-CNN hybrid multimodal NER network that takes as input both image and text for recognition of a named entity in text input. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first work to incorporate visual contexts for named entity recognition tasks. (2) We propose a general modality attention module that selectively chooses modalities to extract primary context from, maximizing information gain and suppressing irrelevant contexts from each modality (we treat words, characters, and images as separate modalities). (3) We show that the proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art NER models (both with and without using additional', 'Neural models for NER have been recently proposed, producing state-of-the-art performance on standard NER tasks.

For instance, one may provide visual contexts only as an initial input to decoder as in some encoder-decoder image captioning systems BIBREF26 .

"How do the authors evidence the claim that many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models and optimization techniques?","['Introduction\nDeep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely employed in industry for solving various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, sequence labeling, question answering, etc. However, when engineers apply DNN models to address specific NLP tasks, they often face the following challenges.\nThe above challenges often hinder the productivity of engineers, and result in less optimal solutions to their given tasks. This motivates us to develop an NLP toolkit for DNN models, which facilitates engineers to develop DNN approaches. Before designing this NLP toolkit, we conducted a survey among engineers and identified a spectrum of three typical personas.', 'As an open-source toolkit, we will further extend it in various directions. The following names a few examples.', 'The technical contributions of NeuronBlocks are summarized into the following three aspects.\nRelated Work\nThere are several general-purpose deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and Keras, which have gained popularity in NLP community. These frameworks offer huge flexibility in DNN model design and support various NLP tasks. However, building models under these frameworks requires a large overhead of mastering these framework details. Therefore, higher level abstraction to hide the framework details is favored by many engineers.', 'original models, with comparative or slightly better performance.', 'There are also several popular deep learning toolkits in NLP, including OpenNMT BIBREF0 , AllenNLP BIBREF1 etc. OpenNMT is an open-source toolkit mainly targeting neural machine translation or other natural language generation tasks.

On which benchmarks they achieve the state of the art?,"['Table 3 compares our system with two published baselines (1) STAGG BIBREF4 , the state-of-the-art on WebQSP and (2) AMPCNN BIBREF20 , the state-of-the-art on SimpleQuestions. Since these two baselines are specially designed/tuned for one particular dataset, they do not generalize well when applied to the other dataset. In order to highlight the effect of different relation detection models on the KBQA end-task, we also implemented another baseline that uses our KBQA system but replaces HR-BiLSTM with our implementation of AMPCNN (for SimpleQuestions) or the char-3-gram BiCNN (for WebQSP) relation detectors (second block in Table 3 ).', 'The third block of the table details two ablation tests for the proposed components in our KBQA systems: (1) Removing the entity re-ranking step significantly decreases the scores. Since the re-ranking step relies on the relation detection models, this shows that our HR-BiLSTM model contributes to the good performance in multiple ways. Appendix C gives the detailed performance of the re-ranking step. (2) In contrast to the conclusion in BIBREF4 , constraint detection is crucial for our system. This is probably because our joint performance on topic entity and core-chain detection is more accurate (77.5% top-1 accuracy), leaving a huge potential (77.5% vs. 58.0%) for the constraint detection', 'Next, we present empirical evidences, which show why our HR-BiLSTM model achieves the best scores. We use WebQSP for the analysis purposes. First, we have the hypothesis that training of the weighted-sum model usually falls to local optima, since deep BiLSTMs do not guarantee that the two-levels of question hidden representations are comparable. This is evidenced by that during training one layer usually gets a weight close to 0 thus is ignored. For example, one run gives us weights of -75.39/0.14 for the two layers (we take exponential for the final weighted sum). It also gives much lower training accuracy (91.94%) compared to HR-BiLSTM (95.67%), suffering from training difficulty.', 'Table 2 shows the results on two relation detection tasks. The AMPCNN result is from BIBREF20 , which yielded state-of-the-art scores by outperforming several attention-based methods. We re-implemented the BiCNN model from BIBREF4 , where both questions and relations are represented with the word hash trick on character tri-grams. The baseline BiLSTM with relation word sequence appears to be the best baseline on WebQSP and is close to the previous best result of AMPCNN on SimpleQuestions. Our proposed HR-BiLSTM outperformed the best baselines on both tasks by margins of 2-3% (p $<$ 0.001 and 0.01 compared to the best baseline BiLSTM w/ words on SQ and WQ respectively).', 'Compared to the baseline relation detector (3rd row of results), our method, which includes an improved relation detector (HR-BiLSTM), improves the KBQA end task by 2-3% (4th row).

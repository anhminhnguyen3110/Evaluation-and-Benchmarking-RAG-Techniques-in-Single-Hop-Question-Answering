What is Saltram's living situation?,"['a large order, as we said, for a short course of five.

There was in those days in that\nregion a petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the\nfunds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the\nmaintenance of five small Saltrams—I include the mother—and one large\none.

Why does Ann not return Mary's feelings of affection?,"[""Mary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these\nconsequences produced. When her friend was all the world to her, she\nfound she was not as necessary to her happiness; and her delicate mind\ncould not bear to obtrude her affection, or receive love as an alms, the\noffspring of pity. Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility."", ""As she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and she\nacquired a degree of equality in her behaviour: yet still her spirits\nwere fluctuating, and her movements rapid. She felt less pain on\naccount of her mother's partiality to her brother, as she hoped now to\nexperience the pleasure of being beloved; but this hope led her into new\nsorrows, and, as usual, paved the way for disappointment. Ann only felt\ngratitude; her heart was entirely engrossed by one object, and\nfriendship could not serve as a substitute; memory officiously retraced\npast scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter."", 'Ann did not take notice of either his or Mary\'s behaviour, nor did she\nsuspect that he was a favourite, on any other account than his\nappearing neither well nor happy. She had often seen that when a person\nwas unfortunate, Mary\'s pity might easily be mistaken for love, and,\nindeed, it was a temporary sensation of that kind. Such it was--why it\nwas so, let others define, I cannot argue against instincts. As reason\nis cultivated in man, they are supposed to grow weaker, and this may\nhave given rise to the assertion, ""That as judgment improves, genius\nevaporates.""\n\n\n\n\nCHAP.

Her friendship for\nAnn occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed,\nseveral transient likings; but they did not amount to love. The society\nof men of genius delighted her, and improved her faculties. With beings\nof this class she did not often meet; it is a rare genus; her first\nfavourites were men past the meridian of life, and of a philosophic\nturn.']",['Because she is in unrequited love with someone else'],23316,narrativeqa,en,,26c6325283dece0b557e34cde9a5c57999ec5c68782e8194,Her heart was entirely engrossed by one object.

She can only take one view of it.  It’s for the\nEndowment or it’s for nothing.”\n\n“The Endowment,” I permitted myself to observe, “is a conception\nsuperficially sublime, but fundamentally ridiculous.”\n\n“Are you repeating Mr. Gravener’s words?” Adelaide asked.', 'Gravener’s directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some\nturn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to\nask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt.

No Han\nactivity was reported, and no Han broadcasts indicated any suspicion of\nour expedition. Nor was there any indication that the Sinsings had any\nknowledge of the fate in store for them. The idling of rep-ray\ngenerators was reported from the center of their camp, obviously those\nof the ships the Hans had given them--the price of their treason to\ntheir race.\n\nAgain I gave the word, and Hearn passed on the order to his\nsubordinates.', ""I went down with the end of the wire. Wilma followed a few feet above\nme, then Barker, Gaunt and Blash. Gibbons, of course, stayed behind to\nhold the ship in position and control the paying out of the line. We all\nhad our ultrophones in place inside our air helmets, and so could\nconverse with one another and with Gibbons. But at Wilma's suggestion,\nalthough we would have liked to let the Big Boss listen in, we kept them\nadjusted to short-range work, for fear that those who had been clearing\nwith the Hans, and against whom we were on a raid for evidence, might\nalso pick up our conversation. We had no fear that the Hans would hear"", ""This meant, to Wilma's logical mind, either that the Hans had perfected\nnew instruments as yet unknown to us, or that somewhere, among the\nWyomings or some other nearby gang, there were traitors so degraded as\nto commit that unthinkable act of trafficking in information with the\nHans. In either contingency, she argued, other Han raids would follow,\nand since the Susquannas had a highly developed organization and more\nthan usually productive plants, the next raid might be expected to\nstrike them.""]",['The Sinsings'],27510,narrativeqa,en,,86d2cd2994feadad471854df8ce765545fe6bab1cee02259,the Sinsings

My awakening, I\nfigured out later, had been due to some shifting of the strata which\nreopened the shaft and cleared the atmosphere in the working.

What does Socrates believe about being judged in the after life if he breaks out of prison?,"[""'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.

For neither\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,"", 'Finally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.', ""SOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  'You, Socrates, are breaking the\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,"", ""Socrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and"", ""angry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\nhe do violence to his country.'

Once or twice in\nthe afternoon it had for an instant occurred to me that perhaps his\njourney was not to be fruitless, that perhaps we had all been wrong in\nour estimate of the works of Enoch Soames.  That we had been horribly\nright was horribly clear from the look of him.  But, ""Don\'t be\ndiscouraged,"" I falteringly said.  ""Perhaps it\'s only that you--didn\'t\nleave enough time.

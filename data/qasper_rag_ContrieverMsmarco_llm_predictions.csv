Since then, governments and corporations alike (e.g. Google BIBREF1 and Facebook BIBREF2 ) have begun efforts to tackle fake news as they can affect political decisions BIBREF3 . Yet, the ability to define, identify and stop fake news from spreading is limited.', 'The conceptual issue of how to define fake news is a serious and unresolved issue. As the focus of our work is not attempting to offer light on this, we will rely on work by other authors to describe what we consider as fake news. In particular, we use the categorization provided by Rubin et al. BIBREF7 . The five categories they described, together with illustrative examples from our dataset, are as follows:\nResearch Hypotheses', 'In relation to the production and distribution of fake news, a recent paper in the field of Economics BIBREF9 found that most fake news sites use names that resemble those of legitimate organizations, and that sites supplying fake news tend to be short-lived. These authors also noticed that fake news items are more likely shared than legitimate articles coming from trusted sources, and they tend to exhibit a larger level of polarization.', 'content could be useful to identify fake news. In the light of this finding, accounts newly created should probably put under higher scrutiny than older ones.

Where G is the number of ghost clusters, we want to add (typically 2-4). The Ghost clusters are added to map any noisy or irrelevant content into ghost clusters and are not included during the feature aggregation stage, as shown in Figure 1 (Right side).

What can word subspace represent?,"['subspace representation.', 'To tackle this problem, we introduce the novel concept of word subspace. It is mathematically defined as a low dimensional linear subspace in a word vector space with high dimensionality. Given that words from texts of the same class belong to the same context, it is possible to model word vectors of each class as word subspaces and efficiently compare them in terms of similarity by using canonical angles between the word subspaces. Through this representation, most of the variability of the class is retained. Consequently, a word subspace can effectively and compactly represent the context of the corresponding text. We achieve this framework through the mutual subspace method (MSM) BIBREF9', 'The word subspace formulation presented in Section ""Word subspace"" is a practical and compact way to represent sets of word vectors, retaining most of the variability of features. However, as seen in the BOW features, the frequency of words is relevant information that can improve the characterization of a text.

Ultimately, our TF weighted subspace formulation resulted in significantly higher accuracy when compared to all conventional text classification methods discussed in this work.

How much improvement is gained from Adversarial Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood (ARAML)?,"[""In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training framework called Adversarial Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood (ARAML) to deal with the instability issue of training GANs for text generation. At each iteration of adversarial training, we first train the discriminator to assign higher rewards to real data than to generated samples. Then, inspired by reward augmented maximum likelihood (RAML) BIBREF17 , the generator is updated on the samples acquired from a stationary distribution with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), weighted by the discriminator's rewards. This stationary distribution is designed to guarantee that training samples are surrounding the real data, thus the"", ""We also provide standard deviation of each metric in Table TABREF33 , reflecting the stability of each model's performance.

How are weights dynamically adjusted?,"['easily. Meanwhile, the model can hardly distinguish between hard-negative examples and positive ones. Inspired by the idea of focal loss BIBREF16 in computer vision, we propose a dynamic weight adjusting strategy, which associates each training example with a weight in proportion to $(1-p)$, and this weight dynamically changes as training proceeds. This strategy helps to deemphasize confident examples during training as their $p$ approaches the value of 1, makes the model attentive to hard-negative examples, and thus alleviates the dominating effect of easy-negative examples.', 'BIBREF22, example weights are obtained through optimizing the weighted training loss which encourages learning easier examples first. At each training step, self-paced learning algorithm optimizes model parameters and example weights jointly. Other works BIBREF23, BIBREF24 adjusted the weights of different training examples based on training loss. Besides, recent work BIBREF25, BIBREF26 proposed to learn a separate network to predict sample weights.', 'The idea of weighting training examples has a long history. Importance sampling BIBREF17 assigns weights to different samples and changes the data distribution. Boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost BIBREF18 select harder examples to train subsequent classifiers. Similarly, hard example mining BIBREF19 downsamples the majority class and exploits the most difficult examples. Oversampling BIBREF20, BIBREF21 is used to balance the data distribution. Another line of data resampling is to dynamically control the weights of examples as training proceeds. For example, focal loss BIBREF16 used a soft weighting scheme that emphasizes harder examples during training.

The data resampling strategy constructs a new dataset by sampling training examples from the original dataset based on human-designed criteria, e.g., extract equal training samples from each class. Both strategies are equivalent to changing the data distribution and thus are of the same nature.

Second, to encode prior knowledge with a prior on parameters, which can be commonly seen in many Bayesian approaches BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . Third, to formalise prior knowledge with additional variables and dependencies BIBREF5 . Last, to use prior knowledge to control the distributions over latent output variables BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , which makes the output variables easily interpretable.', ""However, a crucial problem, which has rarely been addressed, is the bias in the prior knowledge that we supply to the learning model. Would the model be robust or sensitive to the prior knowledge? Or, which kind of knowledge is appropriate for the task? Let's see an example: we may be a baseball fan but unfamiliar with hockey so that we can provide a few number of feature words of baseball, but much less of hockey for a baseball-hockey classification task. Such prior knowledge may mislead the model with heavy bias to baseball. If the model cannot handle this situation appropriately, the performance may be undesirable."", 'Introduction\nWe posses a wealth of prior knowledge about many natural language processing tasks.

We propose three regularization terms on top of generalized expectation criteria. As demonstrated by the experimental results, the performance can be considerably improved when taking into account these factors. Comparative results show that our proposed methods is more effective and works more robustly against baselines.

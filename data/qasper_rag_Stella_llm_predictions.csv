How is the ground truth for fake news established?,"['The conceptual issue of how to define fake news is a serious and unresolved issue. As the focus of our work is not attempting to offer light on this, we will rely on work by other authors to describe what we consider as fake news. In particular, we use the categorization provided by Rubin et al. BIBREF7 . The five categories they described, together with illustrative examples from our dataset, are as follows:\nResearch Hypotheses', ']\nIntroduction\nWhile fake news, understood as deliberately misleading pieces of information, have existed since long ago (e.g. it is not unusual to receive news falsely claiming the death of a celebrity), the term reached the mainstream, particularly so in politics, during the 2016 presidential election in the United States BIBREF0 . Since then, governments and corporations alike (e.g. Google BIBREF1 and Facebook BIBREF2 ) have begun efforts to tackle fake news as they can affect political decisions BIBREF3 . Yet, the ability to define, identify and stop fake news from spreading is limited.', 'In relation to the production and distribution of fake news, a recent paper in the field of Economics BIBREF9 found that most fake news sites use names that resemble those of legitimate organizations, and that sites supplying fake news tend to be short-lived. These authors also noticed that fake news items are more likely shared than legitimate articles coming from trusted sources, and they tend to exhibit a larger level of polarization.', 'Previous works on the area (presented in the section above) suggest that there may be important determinants for the adoption and diffusion of fake news. Our hypotheses builds on them and identifies three important dimensions that may help distinguishing fake news from legit information:\nTaking those three dimensions into account, we propose the following hypotheses about the features that we believe can help to identify tweets containing fake news from those not containing them.

What is the GhostVLAD approach?,"['GhostVLAD is an extension of the NetVLAD approach, which we discussed in the previous section. The GhostVLAD model was proposed for face recognition by Y. Zhong [10]. GhostVLAD works exactly similar to NetVLAD except it adds Ghost clusters along with the NetVLAD clusters. So, now we will have a K+G number of clusters instead of K clusters. Where G is the number of ghost clusters, we want to add (typically 2-4). The Ghost clusters are added to map any noisy or irrelevant content into ghost clusters and are not included during the feature aggregation stage, as shown in Figure 1 (Right side). Which means that we compute the matrix V for both normal cluster K and ghost clusters G, but we will', 'Where $w_k$,$b_k$ and $c_k$ are trainable parameters for the cluster $k$ and V(j,k) represents a point in the V matrix for (j,k)th location. The matrix is constructed using the equation (1) where the first term corresponds to the soft assignment of the input $x_i$ to the cluster $c_k$, whereas the second term corresponds to the residual term which tells how far the input descriptor $x_i$ is from the cluster center $c_k$.\nPOOLING STRATEGIES ::: GhostVLAD pooling', 'we will not include the vectors belongs to ghost cluster from V during concatenation of the features. Due to which, during feature aggregation stage the contribution of the noisy and unwanted features to normal VLAD clusters are assigned less weights while Ghost clusters absorb most of the weight. We illustrate this in Figure 1(Right Side), where the ghost clusters are shown in red color. We use Ghost clusters when we are computing the V matrix, but they are excluded during the concatenation stage. These concatenated features are fed into the projection layer, followed by softmax to predict the language label.', 'RESULTS\nIn this section, we compare the performance of our system with the recent state of the art language identification approaches.

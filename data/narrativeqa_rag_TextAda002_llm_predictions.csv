Why does Ann not return Mary's feelings of affection?,"[""Mary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these\nconsequences produced.

Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility."", ""As she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and she\nacquired a degree of equality in her behaviour: yet still her spirits\nwere fluctuating, and her movements rapid. She felt less pain on\naccount of her mother's partiality to her brother, as she hoped now to\nexperience the pleasure of being beloved; but this hope led her into new\nsorrows, and, as usual, paved the way for disappointment. Ann only felt\ngratitude; her heart was entirely engrossed by one object, and\nfriendship could not serve as a substitute; memory officiously retraced\npast scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter."", ""She often wondered at the books Mary chose, who, though she had a lively\nimagination, would frequently study authors whose works were addressed\nto the understanding. This liking taught her to arrange her thoughts,\nand argue with herself, even when under the influence of the most\nviolent passions.\n\nAnn's misfortunes and ill health were strong ties to bind Mary to her;\nshe wished so continually to have a home to receive her in, that it\ndrove every other desire out of her mind; and, dwelling on the tender\nschemes which compassion and friendship dictated, she longed most\nardently to put them in practice."", 'Ann did not take notice of either his or Mary\'s behaviour, nor did she\nsuspect that he was a favourite, on any other account than his\nappearing neither well nor happy.

This must\nhave been the case, for I was able to struggle back up the shaft over a\npile of debris, and stagger up the long incline to the mouth of the\nmine, where an entirely different world, overgrown with a vast forest\nand no visible sign of human habitation, met my eyes.', 'I was trapped.

Why does Socrates ultimately decide it is unjust to escape?,"[""SOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do"", ""Whether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no"", ""Socrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death"", 'before his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.', 'CRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\ndo as I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\nthe only one.']",['Because it violates his belief in the  laws of society.'],6595,narrativeqa,en,,585ce1f974c0a35526da31a0cdc1541728ffc2df6a73b4f3,unanswerable

He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable,\nwith a considerable fund of local lore.  At his invitation we had taken\ntea at the vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis,\nan independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman's scanty\nresources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house.  The vicar,"", 'It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with\na considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well\nfilled with spring flowers.  Towards this garden the window of the\nsitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis,\nmust have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single\ninstant blasted their minds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully\namong the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch.\nSo absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over\nthe watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the\ngarden path.  Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish', 'It was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram\nfrom Holmes last Tuesday--he has never been known to write where a\ntelegram would serve--in the following terms:\n\nWhy not tell them of the Cornish horror--strangest case I have handled.\n\nI have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter\nfresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should\nrecount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may\narrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the\ncase and to lay the narrative before my readers.', '""Remarkable--most remarkable!"" said Holmes, rising and taking his hat.\n""I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without\nfurther delay.

Their purpose, evidently, had been to\nembroil us with the Altoonas, but fortunately, one of our exchanges\nrecognized the Bad Blood leader, who had been slain.\n\nThe Big Boss had mobilized the full raiding force of the Gang, and was\non the point of heading an expedition for the extermination of the Bad\nBloods.', 'Our own casualties amounted to forty-seven men in the ground forces,\neighteen of whom had been slain in hand to hand fighting with the few of\nthe enemy who managed to reach our lines, and sixty-two in the crew and\n""kite-tail"" force of swooper No. 4, which had been located by one of\nthe enemy\'s ultroscopes and brought down with long-gun fire.\n\nSince nearly every member of the Sinsing Gang had, so far as we knew,\nbeen killed, we considered the raid a great success.\n\nIt had, however, a far greater significance than this.

Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?

When does Reiko realize the curse is still unbroken?,"['Sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse.  \n  Only her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.  The TIPS of her \n  fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail \n  on them.  She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself \n  forward, coming jerkily to her feet.  The joints of her body twist \n  unnaturally, more insect-like than human.\n\n  Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment \n  as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from \n  his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls \n  to the floor, panting heavily.', 'There is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A \n  hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white \n  dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly \n  pulling herself out.  The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills \n  with static as if barely able to contain her image.  \n\n  CUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, \n  and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRYUJI\n</b>\t\t\t(almost frantic) \n\t\tWhy?!', 'Asakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily \n  and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the \n  television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown \n  standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, \n  spins around.\n\n  The room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket--\n\n  --and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie-\n  like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly.', 'She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning \n  over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, \n  everything becomes monochrome. Its not Ryuji looking down at her at \n  all; its Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or \n  if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to \n  Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright.\n\n  Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs \n  from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness.  \n  Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water.  \n  She calls out pleadingly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASAKAWA\n</b>\t\tWhere are you?  Please, come out.', 'CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the \n  vision, has begun to swoon.  Finally her legs give out and she crumples \n  to the beach.

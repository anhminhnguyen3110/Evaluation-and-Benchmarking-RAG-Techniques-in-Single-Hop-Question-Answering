She often appeared at my\nchambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed\nher hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution,\nwhich she handed about for analysis.

Why does Ann not return Mary's feelings of affection?,"[""Mary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these\nconsequences produced.

Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility."", 'I mentioned before, that Mary had never had any particular attachment,\nto give rise to the disgust that daily gained ground. Her friendship for\nAnn occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed,\nseveral transient likings; but they did not amount to love. The society\nof men of genius delighted her, and improved her faculties. With beings\nof this class she did not often meet; it is a rare genus; her first\nfavourites were men past the meridian of life, and of a philosophic\nturn.', ""As she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and she\nacquired a degree of equality in her behaviour: yet still her spirits\nwere fluctuating, and her movements rapid. She felt less pain on\naccount of her mother's partiality to her brother, as she hoped now to\nexperience the pleasure of being beloved; but this hope led her into new\nsorrows, and, as usual, paved the way for disappointment. Ann only felt\ngratitude; her heart was entirely engrossed by one object, and\nfriendship could not serve as a substitute; memory officiously retraced\npast scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter."", 'Mary did not choose to explain herself; had Ann lived, it is probable\nshe would never have loved Henry so fondly; but if she had, she could\nnot have talked of her passion to any human creature. She deliberated,\nand at last informed the family, that she had a reason for not living\nwith her husband, which must some time remain a secret--they stared--Not\nlive with him! how will you live then?

What was Grassou's wife's name?,"[""When Madame Vervelle's portrait was begun that of her husband was nearly\nfinished, and the enthusiasm of the family knew no bounds. The notary\nhad spoken in the highest praise of the painter. Pierre Grassou was, he\nsaid, one of the most honest fellows on earth; he had laid by thirty-six\nthousand francs; his days of poverty were over; he now saved about ten\nthousand francs a year and capitalized the interest; in short, he was\nincapable of making a woman unhappy. This last remark had enormous\nweight in the scales. Vervelle's friends now heard of nothing but the\ncelebrated painter Fougeres."", ""At the present day, Pierre Grassou, who never misses exhibiting at the\nSalon, passes in bourgeois regions for a fine portrait-painter. He earns\nsome twenty thousand francs a year and spoils a thousand francs' worth\nof canvas. His wife has six thousand francs a year in dowry, and he\nlives with his father-in-law. The Vervelles and the Grassous, who agree\ndelightfully, keep a carriage, and are the happiest people on earth.\nPierre Grassou never emerges from the bourgeois circle, in which he\nis considered one of the greatest artists of the period.

Plump and of medium height, he\nhad a dull complexion, brown eyes, black hair, a turned-up nose, rather\nwide mouth, and long ears. His gentle, passive, and resigned air gave a\ncertain relief to these leading features of a physiognomy that was full\nof health, but wanting in action. This young man, born to be a virtuous\nbourgeois, having left his native place and come to Paris to be clerk\nwith a color-merchant (formerly of Mayenne and a distant connection of\nthe Orgemonts) made himself a painter simply by the fact of an obstinacy\nwhich constitutes the Breton character.

The Vervelles and the Grassous, who agree\ndelightfully, keep a carriage, and are the happiest people on earth.\nPierre Grassou never emerges from the bourgeois circle, in which he\nis considered one of the greatest artists of the period. Not a family\nportrait is painted between the barrier du Trone and the rue du Temple"", ""When Madame Vervelle's portrait was begun that of her husband was nearly\nfinished, and the enthusiasm of the family knew no bounds. The notary\nhad spoken in the highest praise of the painter. Pierre Grassou was, he\nsaid, one of the most honest fellows on earth; he had laid by thirty-six\nthousand francs; his days of poverty were over; he now saved about ten\nthousand francs a year and capitalized the interest; in short, he was\nincapable of making a woman unhappy. This last remark had enormous\nweight in the scales. Vervelle's friends now heard of nothing but the\ncelebrated painter Fougeres."", ""While the Vervelle family discussed Pierre Grassou, Pierre Grassou\ndiscussed in his own mind the Vervelle family. He found it impossible to\nstay peacefully in his studio, so he took a walk on the boulevard, and\nlooked at all the red-haired women who passed him. He made a series of\nthe oddest reasonings to himself: gold was the handsomest of metals; a\ntawny yellow represented gold; the Romans were fond of red-haired women,\nand he turned Roman, etc. After two years of marriage what man would\never care about the color of his wife's hair? Beauty fades,--but\nugliness remains! Money is one-half of all happiness. That night when he"", 'But for all this, Grassou gave excellent counsel, like those\nfeuilletonists incapable of writing a book who know very well where a\nbook is wanting. There was this difference, however, between literary\ncritics and Fougeres; he was eminently sensitive to beauties; he felt\nthem, he acknowledged them, and his advice was instinct with a spirit\nof justice that made the justness of his remarks acceptable. After\nthe revolution of July, Fougeres sent about ten pictures a year to the\nSalon, of which the jury admitted four or five. He lived with the most\nrigid economy, his household being managed solely by an old charwoman.\nFor all amusement he visited his friends, he went to see works of art,', 'Nevertheless the modesty, simplicity, and genuine surprise of the good\nand gentle Fougeres silenced all envy and all recriminations. Besides,\nhe had on his side all of his clan who had succeeded, and all who\nexpected to succeed. Some persons, touched by the persistent energy of a\nman whom nothing had discouraged, talked of Domenichino and said:--\n\n""Perseverance in the arts should be rewarded. Grassou hasn\'t stolen his\nsuccesses; he has delved for ten years, the poor dear man!""']",['He feels as the he is still not a real artist.'],7901,narrativeqa,en,,42a2c14632d52bae9db7d4ba4ee0e76a033d95762dc7b88b,unanswerable
